            <h2>1 Nephi 1:1</h2>
            <p>I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my
                father; and having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly
                favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries
                of God, therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.</p>

            <h2>Helaman 5:9</h2>
            <p>O remember, remember, my sons, the words which king Benjamin spake unto his people; yea, remember that
                there is no other way nor means whereby man can be saved, only through the atoning blood of Jesus
                Christ, who shall come; yea, remember that he cometh to redeem the world.</p>
